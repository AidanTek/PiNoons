# Getting Started with Python

Python is a great programming language to learn. It is popular around the world, has a human-friendly *syntax* and will run on practically any computer. It is the most commonly used language on the Raspberry Pi. There are endless tutorials available online to help you to learn - the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/) is a great place to start, you can also download and install Python from there, but the chances are that it is already installed on your system. Another superduper thing is that you can write a Python program in virtually any text editor - nothing fancy is needed, but there are some nice editors available that will make programming a bit more friendly.

Python is a very successful open-source project with many contributors and a welcoming community. In recent years, variations like [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) and [Circuit Python](https://circuitpython.org/) have been designed to run on embedded systems. Projects like [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) are complete web development tool kits - so it is possible to program in Python at various levels, close to the circuitry right up to the cloud! The toughest thing without a doubt is how to find inspiration when there are so many possibilities! Where to start?!

I think an important place to start is to demonstrate how easy it is to make something work in Python, so these topics are designed to introduce some basics.

## Installing Python and an Editor

Python 3 is the latest, current and future version of Python - we are going to be working with this version. Be aware that a large number of tutorials online use Python 2.7, they will be largely compatible, but there are subtle differences that can cause confusion and frustration - try to be aware of which version is being deployed.

[Download Python 3 here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

If you are just starting out with programming, try downloading [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) or alternatively [Mu](https://codewith.mu/) - or you can of course use IDLE which is included with the Python package. If you have experience with another editor, then I'm sure you don't need to be told that you can use that if you prefer!
