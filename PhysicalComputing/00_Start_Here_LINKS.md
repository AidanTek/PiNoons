# Physical Computing with the Raspberry Pi and Python

This section of the repository is dedicated to Physical Computing on the Raspberry Pi. There are a number of Python modules already installed on your Pi that allow you to interface using the hardware 'GPIO' (General Purpose Input Output) pins to other electronic devices - and by extension this allows your Pi to connectto and interact with the real world.

We will focus on some basic components but will also include the Raspberry Pi peripheral camera in this section.
