# Pi Noons Repository

This repository is a collection of files and information for the Pi Noons workshops. It is meant as an information resource for people learning to use the Raspberry Pi, Python programming and Physical Computing on the Pi.

You can view this information in the browser - click on .md files to view text like this in the browser. If you see something you don't understand, consider raising an 'issue' (will require a GitHub account) so it can perhaps be improved, or why not contribute yourself to improve this resource for everyone?

Topics can be found within the folders of this repository.
